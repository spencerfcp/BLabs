Test App for B Labs

Hello BLabs!
Thank you in advance for taking the time out to look over this application. I'm excited to meet with you and look forward to working together in the future. Additionally, thank you for introducing me to Ember.js. I haven't had a chance to really learn the framework in my current position and this gave me a great excuse to do some research on it. I may actually prefer it to Angular. Especially when working in conjunction with Laravel.

To give you a brief run down, this simple application integrates with Yelps API and uses Ember.JS and Laravel You can create an account and do a look up to see the best resturants in a specific area. This app also provides basic search functionality so you can filter your results off price. This application is also fully optimized for mobile devices.
If you have any questions in regards to this Application, please don't hesitate to let me know.
I can be reached at 267-294-7650 or jeff@jeff-spencer.com 

Thanks again, and hope to speak to your soon
